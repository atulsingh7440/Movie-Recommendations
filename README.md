# Final Project for Course 3 - OMDB and TasteDive Mashup ::Movie-Recommendations

This project will take you through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. 
#### The TasteDive API
Query Input : a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc):::
Output/Return : a set of related items

##### The OMDB API 
 Query Input : a movie title ::::
 Output/Return : data about the movie, including scores from various review sites  (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.).


 You will put those two together. You will use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. Youâ€™ll combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.)

# Now, you’ll put it all together. 
# Don’t forget to copy all of the functions that you have previously defined into this code window. 
# Define a function get_sorted_recommendations. 
# It takes a list of movie titles as an input. 
# It returns a sorted list of related movie titles as output, up to five related movies for each input movie title. 
# The movies should be sorted in descending order by their Rotten Tomatoes rating, as returned by the get_movie_rating function. 
# Break ties in reverse alphabetic order, so that ‘Yahşi Batı’ comes before ‘Eyyvah Eyvah’.
